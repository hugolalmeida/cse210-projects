# Hilo
Are you willing to risk everything? Play Hilo and you might be surprised. The rules are simple. Guess if the next card is high or lower. If you are right earn 100 and if you are wrong less 75 points. The game will continue until you wants to play or your points is 0. If you not want to play the game is over.

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and 
browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.

```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the hilo folder and click the "run" button.
